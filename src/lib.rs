//! A `Vec<T>`-like collection which guarantees stable indices and features

//!
//! This crate provides a simple stable vector implementation. You can find
//! nearly all the relevant documentation on
//! [this crate's only type: `StableVec`](struct.StableVec.html).
//!
//! ---
//!
//! In order to use this crate, you have to include it into your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! stable_vec = "0.1"
//! ```
//!
//! ... as well as declare it at your crate root:
//!
//! ```ignore

/// A `Vec<T>`-like collection which guarantees stable indices and features
/// O(1) deletion of elements.
///
/// # Why?
///
/// The standard `Vec<T>` always stores all elements contiguous. While this has
/// many advantages (most notable: cache friendliness), it has the disadvantage
/// that you can't simply remove an element from the middle; at least not
/// without shifting all elements after it to the left. And this has two major
/// drawbacks:
///
/// 1. It has a linear O(n) time complexity
/// 2. It invalidates all indices of the shifted elements
///
/// Invalidating an index means that a given index `i` who referred to an
/// element `a` before, now refers to another element `b`. On the contrary, a
/// *stable* index means, that the index always refers to the same element.
///
/// Stable indices are needed in quite a few situations. One example are
/// graph data structures (or complex data structures in general). Instead of
/// allocating heap memory for every node and edge, all nodes are stored in a
/// vector and all edges are stored in a vector. But how does the programmer
/// unambiguously refer to one specific node? A pointer is not possible due to
/// the reallocation strategy of most dynamically growing arrays (the pointer
/// itself is not *stable*). Thus, often the index is used.
///
/// But in order to use the index, it has to be stable. This is one example,
/// where this data structure comes into play.
///
///
/// # How?
///
/// Actually, the implementation of this stable vector is very simple. We can
/// trade O(1) deletions and stable indices for a higher memory consumption.
///
/// When `StableVec::remove()` is called, the element is just marked as
/// "deleted", but no element is actually touched. This has the very obvious
/// disadvantage that deleted objects just stay in memory and waste space. This
/// is also the most important thing to understand:
///
/// The memory requirement of this data structure is `O(|inserted elements|)`;
/// instead of `O(|inserted elements| - |removed elements|)`. The latter is the
/// memory requirement of normal `Vec<T>`. Thus, if deletions are far more
/// numerous than insertions in your situation, then this data structure is
/// probably not fitting your needs.
///
///
/// # Why not?
///
/// As mentioned above, this data structure is very simple and has many
/// disadvantages on its own. Here are some reason not to use it:
///
/// - You don't need stable indices or O(1) removal
/// - Your deletions significantly outnumber your insertions
/// - You want to choose your keys/indices
/// - Lookup times do not matter so much to you
///
/// Especially in the last two cases, you could consider using a `HashMap` with
/// integer keys, best paired with a fast hash function for small keys.
///
/// If you not only want stable indices, but stable pointers, you might want
/// to use something similar to a linked list. Although: think carefully about
/// your problem before using a linked list.
///
///
///
/// # Note
///
/// This type's interface is very similar to the `Vec<T>` interface
/// from the Rust standard library. When in doubt about what a method is doing,
/// please consult [the official `Vec<T>` documentation][vec-doc] first.
